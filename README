FOO-MVC

NAME

    foo-mvc - a lightweight MVC framework for PHP5

SYNOPSIS

    Many MVC frameworks try to be everything to everyone. foo-mvc gives you
    the basics of managing controllers, models, and views and lets you plug
    in anything else you want (router, db layer).

    
DESCRIPTION

    foo-mvc is based on the idea that everyone has their favorite tools and
    a framework that forces you to use theirs kinda sucks.

    The core FooMVC class is a simple dispatcher. It's designed to work with
    the Router class (URL => controller mapper) but if you prefer your own
    router syntax, use that instead and just pass the controller name to
    FooMVC.

    Another component of most MVC frameworks is a database abstraction layer.
    foo-mvc doesn't come bundled with one, so you can plug in your favorite
    db layer by extending the core model.
                         
DEPENDENCIES

    foo-mvc was written for PHP5 or greater. To use foo-mvc, you will need to first set up
    your index file, and then configure your web server to rewrite all requests to this file.
